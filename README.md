# Misk DSI 2020-01 Week 3

Welcome to the third week of the Misk DSI course. This week we'll wrap up our exploration of Inferential Statistics and delve into Data Visualization with R.

## Course material

The Statistics module is available [here](http://scavetta.academy/misk/stats/_book/index.html). We'll use a [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kjFmlrY=/) to discuss the material in our group sessions.

## Profile building exercises

By the end of the week the instructor should have received and reviewed your first profile-building exercises. 

For further building your portfolio you can continue to build up Exploratory Data Analysis scripts using data sets obtained from, e.g. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (you'll need an accound to access data) or the publically available data sets from the [tidy tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project (This is a GitHub repo, sroll down the readme file to the datasets section.
